<h1>Brand Rules</h1>

<p>Stack Up logos may be enlarged or reduced, but do not alter their height-to-width ratio, manipulate <br>
   the image shape, or add effects like glow or stroke.  Always strive to use the graphics provided in our <br>
   Press Kit or Streamer Kit. While we love to see creative usage of our logos, please ask before remaking <br>
   them in your own publishing applications! <br>

The tagline, "Veterans are our Mission. Gaming is our Passion." should not be used without the Stack Up logo.<br>
They go together, or not at all. <br>

The Stack Up Flashbang may be used as an accessory or icon logo, but should not be used as a full replacement <br>
for the Stack Up logo. <br>
The Stack Up and Flashbang logos have been provided in a variety of different colors for use with different backgrounds. <br>
Please stick as closely as you can to these guidelines: <br><br>

Black body & red flash for lighter backgrounds.<br>
White body & red flash for darker backgrounds.<br>
White body & black flash for red backgrounds.​<br>
​
Clear space minimums are built into the logo files. Please ensure after any resizing that there is one flashbang <>
radius' worth of space between the word body and tagline, <br>
 as well as one top row letter's space between the Stack and Up.<br>
Centering occurs vertically along the "U," and horizontally along the bottom of the space in the "P," as seen in the adjoining image.</p>

    <h2>WHY VIDEO GAMES?</h2>
    <p>Video games are bad for you? That’s what they said about rock-n-roll. <br>

​
We recognize that post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and emotional <br>
distress affect millions of individuals and are a leading cause of isolation, persistent <br>
health issues and hardships within our community.

Active duty military personnel face extraordinary pressure in the line of duty. However, <br>
after their service is over, we understand another challenge begins for many. It is okay to <br>
want to be healthy and seek help, whether facing troubling times, feeling a lack of purpose, <br>
or having lost the will to persevere. At Stack Up, we aim to break down the stigmas associated <br>
with these issues through the use of gaming.</p>
    <p>More than Just a Game? Combat-Themed Gaming Among Recent <br>
      Veterans with Post-traumatic Stress Disorder <br>

​
This article examines recent combat veterans’ experiences of “first-person <br>
shooter” (FPS) gaming and its relationship to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). <br>
Current PTSD treatment approaches increasingly use virtual reality (VR) technologies, <br>
which have many similarities with FPS games. To explore these similarities, this article <br>
presents six case studies from recently separated veterans in New York City who reported <br>
both current PTSD symptoms and regular use of combat-themed FPS games. In open-ended interviews,<br>
participants discussed a range of benefits as well as the importance of regulating use and <br>
avoiding particular contextual dimensions of gaming to maintain healthy gaming habits. <br>
Findings demonstrate the need for more comprehensive study and dissemination of best-practices <br>
information about FPS gaming in the context of combat-related PTSD symptomatology.</p>

    <h2>STUDIES</h2>
    <p>Community Case Study: Stack Up’s Overwatch Program, an Online Suicide <br>
      Prevention and Peer Support Program for Video Gamers <br>
Colder Carras M, Bergendahl M and Labrique AB (2021) Community Case Study: Stack Up’s Overwatch Program,<br>
an Online Suicide Prevention and Peer Support Program for Video Gamers. Front. Psychol. 12:575224 <br><br>

Traditional mental health services are often not enough to meet the needs of people at risk for suicide,<br>
especially in populations where help-seeking is stigmatized. Stack Up, a non-profit veteran organization <br>
whose goal is to use video games to bring veterans together, recognized a need in its gaming-focused online <br>
community and created the Overwatch Program. This suicide prevention and crisis intervention program is <br>
delivered entirely through the Internet by trained community members through Discord text and voice chat. <br>
By combining aspects of virtual gaming communities, veteran mental health, and community-based peer support, <br>
this program provides an innovative format for implementing crisis intervention and mental health support programs.<br>
 We describe here the context and features of the program, an ongoing evaluation project, and lessons learned.</p>
